                                            Anant National University has set up two more COVID-19 recovery facilities in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, in partnership with the Government of Kerala and the Parliamentarians with Innovators for India (PI India), and collaboration with Dr Shashi Tharoor, Anil Anthony, and Cisco.  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            The first recovery facility, 10th in the country, is a 30-bed fully equipped recovery facility, located in a large conference hall at the Panchkarma Ayurveda Institute in Thiruvananthapuram, is phase 1 of a 100-bed project to treat patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19. The second recovery facility, 11th in the country, is located at the Cordova Senior Secondary School in Thiruvananthapuram, which is equipped with 70 of AnantU’s proprietary beds. Besides the medical equipment, the facility has laminated corrugated cardboard beds and tables, designed and manufactured by AnantU, which are affordable and durable.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            With the latest feat, led by Dr Miniya Chatterji, Director of the Anant Centre for Sustainability and Anant Fellowship for Climate Action, AnantU has made provision of nearly 1700 beds across five states in India including Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Gujarat. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            Dr Shashi Tharoor, author and Member of Parliament, lauded Anant National University's initiative of setting up the recovery facility. Dr Tharoor took to social media platforms and extended his gratitude to AnantU's design team and Dr Miniya Chatterji, Director, Centre for Sustainability, Anant National University, for coming up with a quick and affordable solution for the people amidst the ongoing pandemic.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            Besides setting up recovery centres, AnantU also designed and manufactured the first-of-its-kind Anant COVID testing facilities and oxygen ambulances inside auto rickshaws to facilitate rapid testing and assisting patients during emergencies. AnantU is thus providing highly affordable, scalable, and sustainable solutions by mobilizing its in-house designers, urban planning innovators, faculty and students to help India strengthen its defence in this pandemic.

<p>
    AnantU faculty and Communication & Marketing Department Head, Dr Abhishek Kumar’s paper on ‘Humanistic leadership in the TATA Group: The Synergy in Personal Values, Organisational Strategy and National Cultural Ethos’ was recently published in the prestigious ‘Emerald Journal-Cross Cultural and Strategic Management’. The paper was co-authored with Professor Ritu Tripathi of IIM Bangalore.
    </p>
    <p>
    The paper explained how TATA Group has embodied humanistic leadership in its various levels of organisation. The paper defines these humanistic leadership values from a cultural perspective. It explores these values and translates its principles into work ethics and how they have been set up in the corporate setting. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The core principles explored and observed by Dr. Kumar and Professor Tripathi are as follows –
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Founder’s philosophy and core values
    
    <li>Leadership with trust
    
    <li>Community as the key purpose of the enterprise
    
    <li>Senior leaders as mentors and role-models
    
    <li>Ethical code of conduct
    
    <li>Employee-focus
    
    <li>Tacit alignment with Indian cultural values
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    On being asked what Dr Kumar enjoyed the most about writing this paper, Dr. Abhishek said that visiting the roots of TATA Group was a very satisfying experience as he was born and brought up in Jamshedpur. Dr. Abhishek explains that in some sense it was an exploration of his own identity. He loved conceptualising the seven identified humanistic values in terms of terminal and instrumental values and presenting them in an elegant theoretical hypothesis.

                                            Located amidst the green pastures beside a picturesque lake, Anant National University offers learning opportunities that not only facilitates critical thinking and creative ability among its students but also aids in the mental, physical and emotional development of its students.  
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            The University understands the concerns of the outstation students and has worked relentlessly to create accommodation spaces to facilitate their learning and experience at AnantU. Replete with modern infrastructural facilities, the University makes sure that our students feel safe and have access to healthy surroundings to enjoy a peaceful yet fun hostel experience. Hence, Anant National University is taking up new construction projects to give its students the best hostel experience. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            AnantU has taken up construction of new student housing which is an affordable alternative to renting spaces and is sustainable, thus standing true to its philosophy. The innovative construction will house approximately 200 beds. The new hostel will use traditional building techniques using earth and dung and adaptive reuse of fittings and furniture. The corridors will be plastered with mud and dung, and the walls will showcase paintings of traditional motifs by local artists.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            The construction of a new hostel, which will have the HVAC equipment, CCTV cameras, fire alarm systems, china mosaic flooring, electrical requirements, windows, furniture and other facilities resumed on 7th September 2020. Currently, the construction work including plastering, block masonry work and shuttering work for the terrace are in progress. In addition, the wiring work is being completed simultaneously. Work on external plumbing also started along with the making of furniture and door-window. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            The innovative construction aims at creating comfortable, culturally and academically engaging, sustainable and cost-effective housing for AnantU students.

<p>
    We consume textiles, as necessities and fashion, undermining the effect it may have on the environment. We live in an economic system widely known as 'The Materials Economy'. This revenue-driven system, which extracts raw materials and processes them into usable materials, is environmentally, socially and culturally unsustainable. To this end, AnantU’s Fashion and Textile Design [Sustainable Innovation] department, on the 14th of October,  organised a webinar on ‘Conscious Fashion: Materials of the Future’ to enlighten future designers and fashion enthusiasts on the harmful effects of fashion and how to make the industry more sustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
    Organised as part of the 'Sustainable Soft Material', offered as minor by the department, the webinar had sustainability champions Marina Chahboune, Founder of Closed Loop Fashion, Zuzana Gombosova, A biochemist and Founder of Malai Biomaterials and Shikha Shah, Founder of Ahmedabad based AltMat as the panellists. Through the webinar, the panellists shared their experiences and vision for the future by working towards replacing the 'Materials economy' through green innovations that are environmentally, socially and culturally viable.
    </p>
    <p>
    The webinar focussed on the fashion and textile industry, which is one of the most polluting industries in the world, and how it should be revamped to make it more eco-friendly and sustainable. It focussed on changes to be made in the production and consumption of textiles that are in line with the surrounding and the environment. It questioned the products that are utilised and how it can be made better to save the environment and its future. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The conversation brought a lot of value to the table as the panellists walked the attendees through everything ranging from the effects of cotton and hemp, their start-up journey, what they believe the world deserves and everything that the students are currently being educated on. The webinar ended with a Question and Answer session that shed light on the practical, consistent efforts being put by conscious experts, such as our speakers, to safeguard the planet.

<p>
    A student’s journey in college is all about taking up a challenge and giving their best shot at it. It is about perfecting skills that they might have, add something new in their skillset, and get a taste of a different experience.
    </p>
    <p>
    Aslesha Anchan’s internship began with a curiosity to try out something new during her break. Amongst many emails, she received one about an internship with the Asha Akanksha Foundation, an NGO working to spread awareness and provide quality education to those who don’t have access to it, from AnantU’s Career Services. Equipped with good communication and interaction skills, Ashlesha applied for the internship and started her journey in June 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ashlesha worked on making posters and videos for the foundation's Instagram page in addition to making an explanation video on how to use a Government portal website. As the general populace face difficulty in using the websites, this effort was to educate them on how they can use the government portals for their benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
    When asked about what was one thing that she liked about the NGO, she said that the NGO’s effort to educate the children and indulge them in making handcrafted ornaments appealed to her the most. According to Aslesha, this independence that the NGO teaches to the children is an invaluable learning experience. Looking at the children's smiling faces were heartwarming moments for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    “It felt good to be part of such an initiative. The internship helped me refine my skills on vector-based graphic software and introduced me to animation as a medium to make videos. It taught me the importance of patience. The work might be a bit tiring, but a good organisation will consider your skills and inspire you to give your best output”, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of her internship, Ashlesha received high praise from the foundation along with four-star remarks for doing commendable work. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Congratulations to her on her achievement and hope to see great works from her.

                                            In his keynote speech, 'Exhibiting Global South: Vietnam and Beyond'., Professor Galla answered questions such as what design thinking for exhibitions as critical mediators for communicating heritage values? Is design thinking truly interdisciplinary? If so, how could it become useful in future museum development and transformations in Vietnam and India? How does it all translate during the Pandemic and afterwards?

                                            Professor Galla also reflected on his experiences gathered while he was working on the development of the museum in Hanoi,  a major demonstration project in Southeast Asia, for over a decade where he trained its staff and partners from 2000. His speech highlighted how Indians are chasing western museums, because of colonial hangovers,  without the capacity or capability to ape them. He also suggests that there is more to learn from Asian countries such as Vietnam for Indian museums and exhibit designers.

<p>
The MakerSpace at AnantU forms an integral part of the 'Learning by Doing'. It facilitates a hands-on approach to learning through experimentation, model making and prototyping.
</p>
<p>
With the current semester being conducted online, the MakerSpace has donned an active role in assisting students with their projects. The team waits attentively for requests from students on Whatsapp groups, regarding issues on various aspects of their hands-on work while at home, away from campus. MakerSpace interventions include but are not limited to: Instructing students on facets related to choice of materials, processes and tools to execute their ideas, and how and why of  processes to make parts. 
</p>
<p>
The team instructs the students on technical details such as conceptualising, making and assembling a product, shares videos and tutorials that demonstrate the practical implications of theories and provide solutions to specific queries raised by the students such as generating recycling polymers from waste products, selection of proper grades and type of polymers for a Near Field Communication tag enabled device; Videos on creating Polymer out of milk protein and other such interesting aspects. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, during the COVID19 pandemic, the team designed innovative products such as visors that were donated to front-line health workers and protective forces for their safety. Watch this space to know about more such innovations from the MakerSpace team.

<h3>Featured Projects</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>3D printed Robotic Arm Demonstrator</strong></p>
<p>
A robotic arm, demonstrator model, was made for the benefit of our students to understand the basic working of a Robotic arm. It is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm. The arm may be the total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot. This model can demonstrate how a Robotic arm is operated and how the commands are sent to it from a programmable hardware
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The model was taken from the creative common type of resource as a downloadable STL assembly data. This was then 3D printed in our in-house 3D printer. Additionally, the servomotors and the basic power and intelligence was provided from our Electronics Workbench. The robot operated by programmes running on our Arduino Uno boards, that send motion commands to the arms servo motors. These then execute the motions and demonstrate the inner working of a typical Robotic Arm. The project was made using Poly Lactic Acid and ABS filaments, the arms are sturdy and have great strength.
</p>
<p>
The project was an initiative of the MakerSpace team, which employed technological subjects like automation and technical design.
</p>
<p><strong>Smart Chair</strong></p>
<p>
The MakerSpace team designed a prototype of a folding chair which can be turned into a smart chair. This prototype continuously detects the position of the users back in reference to the backrest of the chair. The moment the distance falls into a range indicating slouching posture, the buzzer immediately notifies the user, so s/he can avoid slouching posture. The project was made using a bamboo chair with added intelligence of an ultrasonic range finder and a programmable Arduino board. The chair can solve medical problems of the spine, and the circuit can also be used in the automobile car seat so that the driver can easily control its movements.
</p>
<p><Strong>Tensor Table</Strong></p>
<p>
The Makerspace team created the tensor table also known as the levitation table to demonstrate how the table surface stays put despite the absence of any solid connection between the base and the top. Levitation is the process by which an object is held aloft, without mechanical support, in a stable position. Levitation is accomplished by providing an upward that counteracts the pull of gravity, plus a smaller stabilizing force that pushes the object toward a home position whenever it is a small distance away from that home position.

    Master’s in Urban Design programme at AnantU in collaboration with Pratt Institute and SASI Creative School of Architecture, Tamil Nadu, conducted its first academic exchange session to study urban areas in India. The three academic institutes collaborated for the creation of a knowledge and resource sharing platform to study current trends, practices and innovations in urban design and planning in India and across the globe. 
</p>    
<p>
    Academics, practitioners and experts across the country participate in discussions which give insight into studying urban areas and share their expertise on various topics and projects shared during the academic exchange. 
</p>    
<p>
    In addition, the collaboration aims at connecting students, alumni, professionals across the globe with domain experts to discuss and conduct research, gain relevant resources and seek expert opinion on multiple projects. One of the major highlights of this academic exchange is that anyone from any college or University can connect with AnantU faculty to seek help for their project, innovation or research and they will be redirected to an appropriate expert to guide them through their project. 
</p>    
<p>
    Currently, the collaboration has around twelve active members, divided into a team of four people. Each team shares a project or an idea they are currently working on and seek expert opinion through this collaboration. The academic exchange, held periodically, is open to all urban planning and design enthusiasts who take part in the presentation and ask questions to understand the project and this field better.

<strong>FELLOWSHIP WEBINAR: SKILLS FOR THE FUTURE</strong>
</p>
<p>
A technologically driven era accounts for a better understanding of the role of technology in a skilled future. The dynamic development of an individual through the present availability of technology is a must and to address the audience in an engaging topic such as this, Mr Adil Zainulbhai took up a seminar on the ‘Skills for the future’. Mr Adil is the chairman of ‘Quality Council of India’ and works closely with senior government leaders to drive growth and raise living standards, strengthen key sectors of the economy, and improve education, health, and welfare.
</p>
<p>
Mr Zainulbhai has worked in both government and private sectors. From Harvard to India, he shared his experience as he understands that every sector or industry can be transformed into a better shape with the help of technology. He noted that at the present moment we are utilising the majority of the technology available to us to do our daily work that previous to the lockdown was done offline. This has opened new ideas and brought the world closer in terms of global accessibility. Education being the most widespread has harnessed this opportunity into creating a virtual world of accessing the most crucial knowledge from anywhere, anytime. The online education system can provide the remotest place in the world to be a part of the major league education and has opened up various avenues. 
</p>
<p>
Mr Zainulbhai also mentioned that like education, the government also realises the ease of accessibility that has been provided through technology to reach people everywhere. Technology can be used to reach the poor and cater to society's needs without corruption in the most efficient manner. Not to forget healthcare is proving to be more and more accessible to people around the world. 
</p>
<p>
In this webinar, he also added that improvement of crop quality and the relation between the farmer and the consumer can also be largely helped through technology. Further, Mr Zainulbhai concluded the lecture stating that the use of technology is not always a boon but if used with the truest of the intention, can lead to such beautiful nations, societies and individuals.

<strong>FELLOWSHIP WEBINAR: The Past, Present and Future of Government</strong>
</p>
<p>
The fellowship is a journey of experiential discovery to create an equitable balance between theory and praxis, instruction and experimentation, and paced-learning and open-ended discovery.
</p>
<p>
Mr Amrut Patel, a Bureaucrat and senior IAS officer in the PMO office spoke about his invigorating journey of working in the government sector for 40 years in the lecture titled ‘The Past, Present and Future of Government’. This seminar addressed eight extensive topics on the constant updating of the government’s strategies with time. 
</p>
<p>
He talked about the role of the governing bodies which has been consolidated from the beginning till the present days in terms of tactics, creativity and technological upgradation. He added how technology is a major instrument in reaching out to people and how the government leverages it in the best possible way to cater to people. 
</p>
<p>
Mr Patel mentioned that in the present scenario, the government has opened up doors for not only officers and bureaucrats but also people from the corporate industries for fresh and creative ideas that generate new perspectives for the overall development of infrastructure or technology.

                                            I love to read about interesting things that happen around the world, so if you’re like me, go ahead and read these tidbits of information that I’ve discovered over the past month! I hope you learn something new after reading~

                                            <strong>1. A Cat to be Officially Ordained Stationmaster!</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            There’s a cat in Japan, named Yontama, who is the latest in a line of officially ordained stationmasters of the Wakayama Electric railway. The first, Tama, though deceased, holds the positions of ‘Honorary Eternal Stationmaster’ and spirit goddess ‘Tama Daimyōjin’ (たま大明神). 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            This bizarre but cute situation is also the very definition of ‘Nekonomics’ in practice, a term coined by the Japanese that refers to how cats can have an influence on the economy. In this case, Tama and his successors single-handedly saved the Kishigawa railway line in Japan’s Wakayama prefecture from being shut down.
                                            </p>

                                            <strong>2. Brain Abnormality! What’s that?</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            A man of French nationality, who despite having most of his brain eroded, lives a relatively normal, healthy life as a civil servant married with two children.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            The majority of his brain was compressed into a thin layer of tissue lining his skull as a result of fluid build-up from a condition called ‘hydrocephalus’.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            Amazingly, despite his minimal remaining brain tissue, the man wasn't mentally disabled - he had a low IQ of 75, but was working as a civil servant and had a normal family. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            Though it merely seems like a miracle, it has wider implications, especially in understanding ‘human consciousness’ and how we as humans perceive it.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            Even though this man’s remaining brain was tiny, the leftover neurons were still able to generate a theory about themselves, which means the man remained conscious of his actions.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            This renewed understanding of the capabilities of the human brain (which are still largely mysterious to us) can help in understanding and reversing illnesses that result in neurodegeneration.

                                            In the above image, the black region is all fluid, the thin grey matter lining the skull is all that is remaining of the man’s brain - 10% of what is present in normal human beings.

<p>
    Among Us, a social deduction game has been a worldwide sensation during these times. While the game was launched way back in June, 2018, the player base has increased tremendously over the last few months. The game has seen an increase of over 145k+ players over the last 2 months.
    </p>
    <p>
    This trend wave has caught up with AnantU too, be it juniors or seniors. While we face our online classes, the lifestyle has become too monotonous and it is always a good idea to take a break, and what better way to spend some time with friends on this social thriller, Among Us. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Frankly, when smiley google meets starts to grate, Among Us will be there, ready to whisk you into your private version of Drama, where the chat is not about getting feedback and redos but whether or not your friend was the one who sabotaged the oxygen supply and should therefore be pushed out in the cold vacuum of space. In this age of widespread assignments and work, Among Us stimulates the only part of College most of us secretly miss: gossip and drama. No amount of Google Meets can ever replicate that.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you do wish to meet people who are in AnantU and share the same enthusiasm of Among Us, you can join the Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/2PAfVkZ">here</a>, and don’t forget to fix the oxygen supply!

<p>
    The beagle walked down the streets of Delhi looking for scraps of garbage in his search for food. The busy roads of the city lost the crowd that used to walk upon it once. It felt as if the beings on the streets were an outcast, whose existence was ignored in the face of the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
    He walked on the street aimlessly. Survival was something that had become intrinsic to his behaviour. With each passing day, he was leaving behind his old self and gaining his wild feral nature that his ancestors had abandoned. He even forgot the name given to him by his old master.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the whole thing began, countless news popped on the smartphone of the Verma family’s patriarch. One of the news had the following headline: “Studies show that dogs spread Coronavirus”
    </p>
    <p>
    The news had no scientific backing, but the patriarch had a responsibility to keep his family safe. After careful consideration, he chose to let the dog out of the house. The dog joyfully went out, as he expected his master to join him for a walk. Instead, he heard the doors shut.
    </p>
    <p>
    The family tried to convince him to let the beagle in, but he had to take the hard call. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The beagle kept barking for quite a while.
    </p>
    <p>
    The patriarch felt the pain of the dog, but with the irritation that each successive bark brought to the ambience of the place, that pain mutated into anger.
    </p>
    <p>
    He opened the door. The dog was happy to see his master, but the master was not. He picked up a stone and threw at the dog. He screamed at him, as the responsibility of keeping his family safe weighed on him. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Scared, the beagle ran away from the place he knew as home.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the first few days, he followed all that remotely smelled like food but everywhere the food was in the same condition: In a dumpster with a repulsive stench.
    </p>
    <p>
    Till that point, he searched as hard as he could, but now the desperation of his rumbling stomach compelled him to take a bite of the leftover meat on chicken bones.
    </p>
    <p>
    He ate a piece of meat.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was as repulsive as it smelled, but the food in his mouth brought the desire of his hungry belly to the forefront. He didn’t want to be hungry; he had to swallow it down.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the food reached down to his belly, it was a strange satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
    With time, he adapted and started scavenging for food in all sorts of places. However, in the growing days of lockdown, the beagle found the number of his food source shrinking. He started expanding the area of his food search. During his hunt, he came across a couple of street dogs he had met for the first time. The beagle had seen dogs, but these gave a vibe of uncivilized.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the big dogs came forward. Grim was imprinted on his face. He gave out a series of loud barks, directed towards the beagle. There was no intent of communication in those barks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They were pure malice. 
    </p>
    <p>
    A signal of retaliation for the one who encroached on their territory.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>To be continued…</strong>

                                    <p>Advaita is an incredibly curious person, with a talent for getting lost on the internet (and lost
                                        in thought). She has vast interests ranging from melodies and mysteries to paradoxes and
                                        pictographs and anime…the list goes on and on. The one true love of her life is food, and
                                        she's never hesitant to try out something new, be it a food, an experience or an adventure!
                                        Learning new things is her one goal in life and- Did I mention she absolutely adores cats?</p>
