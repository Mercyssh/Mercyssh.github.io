            <p> 
            D.N Hall also known as Dadabhai Navroji Hall is the pride of The Architecture Department of Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU). Located in the heart of the main campus of MSU, it is an Architectural marvel designed in 1915. It was originally designed as a guest house for British Officials and then later as a boys hostel till the early 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was later converted into the administrative wing for the Department of Architecture and a new building was designed at its rear end for the Academic Section.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking at the campus from a philosophical point of view, one discovers the subtle expressions and design intentions that make an individual connect with it on a deeper level, rather than considering it as a mere architectural piece.
            </p>
            <p>
            As Christian Wolff has rightly quoted <em>“Architecture is a science for constructing a building so that it is in complete correspondence with architect’s intention”, </em>The intention was to create a structure which is a sculpture in itself with all the functional aspects and forms the base of inspiration for the students.
            </p>
            <p>
            The building in itself looks perfect and raw in its appearance. But it is the exposed brick and concrete walls dotted with murals and sculptures that bring about a strong sense of belonging. The walls of the campus are like a canvas for its students, where they are free to paint their expressions. These walls adorn the murals and art pieces of its students like a queen adorns her crown. Proudly flaunting her beauty to her spectators.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every nook and corner of the campus holds blissful memories of different generations of Architects. Each batch of students has carved out space for themselves, their very first design as an undergraduate.
            </p>
            <p>
            ‘THE POND’ – which is the fruit of a long night of labor. Now it’s the most happening space which has witnessed numerous students being thrown inside as a long-standing Birthday Tradition!
            </p>
            <p>
            ‘THE OPEN AMPHI’ – Which gave the dean a heart attack! It came out of nowhere one casual Monday morning. But now hosts several casual discussions during classes and lunch breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
            And not to forget, the beloved furry friend of all the students and teachers of the campus – MUSKY. The four-legged dog holds the record of attending a maximum number of lectures.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking from the perspective of the well-renowned philosopher and designer Ludwig Wittgenstein, the building is a juxtaposition of cubes and cuboids placed upon each other. Voids are created to generate a form. It is free from all kinds of details and articulation and beautiful in its simplistic form. The aesthetics are articulated through the careful proportions of the rooms and spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
            The grand double-height terraces, play in the ceiling heights and a careful arrangement taking care of the symmetry, geometry, and harmony of the spaces create a sense of interactiveness between the space and its users.
            </p>
            <p>
            But most importantly, this campus is a gift. It is passed down from one generation of Architects to another, with a promise that the campus would always be proud of them. The campus was designed by ‘The Kalabhavan Association of Architects’ and is a product of their love for their college and juniors. And so even though a passer-by or outsider may consider this campus an institutional building, to its students it would also feel like a home away from home.
            </p>

                                        Home to centuries-old architectural marvels with Mughal and Hindu influences, the city of Ahmedabad, the first in India to be inscribed in UNESCO’s World Heritage City List,  is a testament to the rich traditional form of architecture and design whilst charting the path for modern architecture in India. Adorned with edifices by renowned internationalists like BV Doshi, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Charles Correa, the ‘Design City’ in the making is a place that leaves everyone with souvenirs of its diversity and culture. Architecture, especially among design and textile, plays a major role in the foundation and sustenance of the city. Standing today in this largest city are five celebrated buildings intricately crafted by these renowned architects.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Tagore Hall, a masterpiece by international award-winning architect B.V. Doshi, is a memorial theatre built to honour the contributions of legendary artist and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. The work highlights B.V Doshi's unique architectural style. The wall columns, a series of rigid concrete folded plates frame the outer shell to the structure blending smoothly with the hall as a whole, and the very bucolic Premabhai Hall with its exposed raw concrete facade looks engaging in its Brutalist style. The humanistic tone in the seating sans balcony adds greater intimacy to artists despite the exposed concrete structure and the floating acoustical clouds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Le Corbusier, The Father of Modern Architecture, tailored The Sanskar Kala Kendra and Ahmedabad Textile Mill Owners Association (ATMA) building with rustic exteriors of exposed brickwork and concrete with sun breaker fin made of exposed concrete and a long entrance of ramps that are so distinct yet profound in re-establishing the birth of Modern Architecture in Ahmedabad, and an extent, on the Indian landscape.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya is a contemporary expression for the spirit of swadeshi creatively captured by Ar. Charles Correa and is a modular personification of Gandhi Ji's simplicity. The use of stone floors, brick walls, wooden doors and louvred windows devoid of glass and the tiled roofs showcases the simplicity of Indian life. The units grouped in a consciously asymmetric manner to be analogous to the Indian village with its pathways and seemingly randomly placed buildings are methodically woven to narrate a story.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        "We shape our buildings, and thereafter they shape us", as marked by the former Prime Minister of UK, stands true for IIM Ahmedabad, an architectural phenomenon conceptualised and given final form by the prolific Ar. Louis-I-Kahn. One of the most sought business schools in the country and an architectural marvel that puts India on the global map, the building implements techniques from the design of 'The National Assembly' Building in Bangladesh. Architect Kahn incorporated local materials (brick and concrete) and large geometrical façade extractions as a homage to Indian vernacular architecture. The masterpiece oozes Kahn’s idea that education can be found everywhere, beyond the classrooms in the space around us, thus making IIM an ideal place to pursue knowledge.

<p>
                                        Dr Subhalaxmi Mohapatra, Associate Professor, recently received the second-best Case Award at the 10th International Conference on Management Cases – 2020 for her research paper titled, “Beeja: Sprout into Bloom or Wither into Doom”. 

</p>    
<p>
                                        Organised by BIMTECH Noida in collaboration with the University of Eastern Finland and the University of South Florida, Dr Mohapatra co-authored the paper with Dr Subhadip Roy, Associate Professor, IIMA.

</p>                                        
<p>
                                        The case study documented the dilemma of the founders of Beeja - a social entrepreneurship venture that seeks to create alternate livelihood opportunities for the crafts community.

</p>                                        
<p>
                                        “The present case study is about Beeja, an organisation formed in 2005 as UCMA design studio to create sustainable communities among rural farmers by providing them training and assistance, which could provide alternative livelihood options to rural farmers", said Dr Mohapatra.

</p>                                        
<p>
                                        "The primary-data based case illustrates the problem of the founders' dilemma. Besides, It highlights the role of organisational structures in the success and continuance of a firm. The case brings out various challenges faced by social entrepreneurs. The paper serves as an example of the Agency theory as it centres around the principal-agent problem and links to theories of social entrepreneurship and ethics", she added.

                                        Professor Ashima Banker and her team won incubation support for her research on 'Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction’ for ASHA-India scheme by MoHUA.

                                        Professor Banker presented her project in the 'Preprototype Potential Technology' category as a part of the ‘Global Housing Technology Challenge – India’, a platform to mainstream innovative and sustainable construction technologies in the affordable housing sector. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Government of India, launched the challenge in February 2019. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The project will receive technical and financial support for future absorption in the construction sector, for product development, mentoring and monitoring, prototyping, company incorporation, patent guidance and business model assistance, through incubation and acceleration at premier technical institutes (4 IITs identified) and BMTPC in collaboration with selected Knowledge Partners (KPs). 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Additionally, six winning entries after the incubation, will assist in constructing 1000 houses at each of the identified six sites across India. These affordable housing projects are under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).
                                        </p>

                                        “In February 2019, I received an invitation from World Research Institute (WRI), India (knowledge partner to MoHUA), to attend Expo-cum-Conference on 2-3 March 2019 at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, and do a poster presentation for the category 'Potential Future Technologies' for the housing sector”, said Professor Banker.

                                        After the approval from Dr Pramath Raj Sinha, the team submitted their entry in the form of a poster. The poster was selected among the top eight entries from 80+ entries and was presented to the honorary Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the event held on 2-3 March 2019 in Delhi.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “Our entry got shortlisted in June 2019 and we were invited to make the final pitch, on 3rd July 2019 in Delhi, to the eminent panel (comprising representatives from IIT Chennai, IIT Mumbai, BMTPC, HUDCO and MoHUA). We were amongst the 20 odd entries shortlisted”, Professor Banker added.

                                        <p>
                                        The team received a formal intimation from MoHUA stating their win. The idea will be incubated in IIT Roorkee for technical and financial support for future absorption. The winners were formally announced during the ASHA-India awards online event on 1st Jan 2021.

                                        “We hope that winning this challenge will prove to be a great opportunity for us and our students for the learning experience we gained from it during the product development and prototyping phase”, said Professor Ashima Banker.

                                        Nakul Sharma, currently pursuing his post graduation in Integrated Product Design from AnantU, inspired by his personal experiences and creative learning in the field of developing softwares and design came up with a solution, <strong>a smart social distancing jacket</strong>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Nakul along with Milind Chitale (Associate Professor, AnantU), Parth Atulkumar Shah (Assistant Professor, AnantU) and Nikita Bavishi Shah (Assistant Professor, Sal College of Engineering) decided to progress with his idea and started working towards his design process.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        A smart jacket equipped with an Arduino + 3 ultrasonic distance sensors, a small LCD display, battery and buzzers can be the next step towards smart clothing. Combining both technology and fashion, the jacket alerts its user about the distance of people around him/her. If anyone crosses within a certain radius of the jacket, a coded program in arduino triggers the buzzers and alerts the user as well as the people around him/her. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        While the idea sounds simple, Nakul explains its complexities. The design process is complex as it raises issues like the weight of the jacket, how people will react to it and how comfortable it will be. Observing and perfecting such issues is the key to a good product. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Doing extensive user research both physically and online, Nakul explains that ideas of somewhat similar comparison exist, it only makes a difference if you work on them instead of just perfecting them in theory.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        While the idea is still in the mill and Nakul continues to work on the prototype, he says that hands-on learning besides ideation is equally important for complete understanding, gaining confidence and making minor adjustments to the innovation which can not be observed in theory. One should not be demotivated because an idea already exists, in a world of 7.8 billion people there will always be ideas already thought upon but only a very few actually worked upon them.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Nakul believes that the innovation will open a lot of scope about smart wear and can help not just in social distancing but also a plethora of other things as well.
                                        </p>

                                        Four students from Anant National University, Aryaraj Salunkhe, Kaushik Kalal, Nirmitee Rakvi and Nishad Shirodkar from B.Des Product Design participated in a Design Sculpting workshop conducted by TCS Design Studio and  General Motors in December.

</p>    
<p>
                                        Around 40 students from 12 Design Schools across India participated in this five-day workshop, conducted by various digital sculptors working at General Motors India in Bangalore. The workshop comprised different sessions such as training exercises, technical presentation and software training sessions for various Autodesk softwares, mainly Autodesk Alias AutoStudio. The students sculpted the Tesla Cybertruck as part of the masterclass, which allowed them to interact with inspirational domain experts and mentors through feedback sessions.

</p>                                        
<p>
                                        The Office of Career Services facilitated AnantU students' participation in the workshop. It allowed students to enhance their surface modelling skills and learn about best practices in the automotive industry.

                                        The students presented their observations on the works of interior designer Ameet Mirpuri. As part of the workshop, they had a detailed conversation with Ameet Mirpuri, understood the intricacies of his projects and presented their work on the following projects

                                        With all the professional photographs, renderings, and files of the places, students analysed different aspects, such as colour pallet, material pallet, and cultural benefit from the context. They discovered the unique story of designing each place, such as how every component was designed from scratch, inspired by the local heritage, with the help of local artisans. They analysed different rooms of the place which brought in details about the inspiration and characteristics of each of the components such as doors, windows, columns among others in the room.

                                        AnantU students presented all their findings to the panellists that took place on 9th December. Panellists and designer Ameet Mirpuri appreciated the presentation for the detailed observation and structure. The students also received valuable advice to carry forward in the future. A panel discussion was also organised amongst all students and panellists to discuss the presentations and various questions pertaining to the domain, such as the importance of context in the building, sustainable architecture, among many others.

                                    <p>

                                        Gaurav Sonkavde, Mruga Raut and Sahil Fadia, students of Master of Design in Urban Design, along with students from Pratt Institute, participated in the Placemaking Competition and were shortlisted in the top 20, which received more than 100 entries. Organised by Trust for Regeneration of Indian Settlements (TRIS India) and Multilogue Collective (MLC), the competition required them to reimagine a public space to enhance socialisation, community engagement, inclusion and equity of that place. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    
                                        The public place chosen for a real-life experience was Chitranjan Park in Delhi. It represents a mini-Bengal in itself, after being built in the name of Indian activist Chitranjan Das. The place is a blend of Bengali culture and modernity. While re-designing the space, the students emphasised socio-cultural interactions, inclusion and barrier-free movement across the park.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    
                                        The project focussed on planned parking spaces through planters for people to avoid the crowd. Provisions were made for all categories including a ramp for the disabled, to a proper sitting and whiling space for the fast-food eaters. In contrast to the current unorganised parking space at the entrance, the newly designed space has trees for shading the parked vehicles. Comfort has been taken care of with multiple sitting spaces all around the park, utilising the staircase as a sitting space as well. Vintage elements from Bengal culture were used, such as the green windows, yellow ambassador car, a rectangular pattern umbrella in addition to the reminiscence of 1970’s Satyajit Ray films. An activity area has been designed for children to play board games, hopscotch et al.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The students designed the project with an agenda of helping the community and upraising the Bengali culture. The competition helped students work in collaboration and learn from peers, along with international exposure. It allowed them to work on a real-life project which exposed them to critical urban design processes ranging from community engagement, stakeholder consultation, placemaking to street design.
                                    </p>

                                        B.Arch students participated in two trophies: MSL Trophy and GSEN Trophy. Themed on Rudiments, preparation for each of the competitions were different. The works produced by students highlighted their technical, analytical, and teamwork skills. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Second-year B.Arch students with guidance from their seniors and faculty participated in the <strong>Mohammad Shaheer Landscape(MSL) Trophy. The project required them to </strong>explore the balance between art, science, and nature through a landscape intervention. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The students chose Anant National University as their site and worked around four areas on the campus. They analysed the soil profile and climatology, amongst other things to get an idea of the site. To get a thorough understanding of the use case and the users, they mapped out activities, demographics, user groups, and the site's evolution with time. With data collected around the space, they started ideating.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        For the space near the Eiffel tower, a scattered illusion of the institution’s tagline was designed to emphasise the University’s ethos. Ideas for introducing the gurukul culture were implemented by having stone seating under the shady trees. Spaces were converted for appreciation and pathways for a moment of tranquillity.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The <strong>G-Sen </strong>trophy was<strong> </strong>centred on urban design with agricultural productivity and enhancement of biodiversity for resilient landscapes. The 12-member group chose the site of the area near the NID Bridge, where they worked on the integration of the farming landscape in an urban context. It was about compensating nature for things that we took away from her. They did their site survey, analysis, and documentation which helped them design the interventions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The ideas had microscopic elements such as integrating roof gardening, backyard farming, hydroponics, and pot farming. The sack method of growing vegetables for societies in slums and an eco-corridor was designed for the animals. Everything tied into the bigger picture of a social structure that had a barter system to exchange foods and use the wastes as biodiesel for vehicles. A social program was planned with different modules that would be overseen by an administration built for ensuring the smooth working of this system.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The competition helped participants learn many things for the first time through a hands-on approach. However, amidst this pandemic, the projects proved to be an enriching experience as it enabled everyone to socialise and build something great.

                                        The pandemic has forced everyone to ponder over the regular course of life and break free of the mediocrity through creative yet practical design innovations. Anant National University, along with its staff and students, has embarked on the journey where pandemic, instead of a hindrance, has proved to be an opportunity to create unique design solutions for existing and new problems.

In a recent initiative, the Centre had launched a competition where they asked the AnantU students to design cost-effective scrubs for healthcare professionals.

                                        Aditi Bhalekar, a foundation year student, won the contest by designing an easy to wear, cost-effective scrub with storage space for personal belongings. Aditi designed high quality-acceptable cotton-mix jumpsuit tailored for the purpose of holding personal possessions and medical equipment, can be easily taken off and comfortable to use for long periods. The jumpsuit consisted of multiple pockets, front zipper, medium-length sleeves and was priced at only Rs 280, which is Rs 60 less than the existing scrubs. The minute detail of printing ‘COVID Warrior’ at the back of the scrub served as a twinge of positivity and motivation for those keeping their lives in danger to save patients.

                                        Used by the medical staff at Anant COVID–19 recovery facility in Najambaug, Mumbai, the scrubs have received a positive response from over 50 nurses and doctors. AnantU is now planning to provide these scrubs in existing as well as upcoming COVID-19 Recovery centres. “I am glad the design found acceptance by its end users,” said Aditi. “This whole process has been a huge learning curve for me.”

                                    <p>
                                        Recently, Garima Sharma, Advaita Jairam, Laddhi Mehta, Namrata Swargari, Pari Nirmal, Ashlesha Anchan, Janhavi Bhole, Vatsal Vora, Nishit Solanki and Teja Naidu as students of AnantU had the opportunity to participate in a cultural exchange workshop titled, ‘ Undivided Identities: Unknown Stories of the Partition’ organised by Bangalore-based organisation, ReReeti Foundation for Museums, along with 10 students of Pakistan from National College of Arts, Pakistan. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The workshop delved into the experiences of the migrants of both countries at the time of the famously tumultuous Partition in 1947, and through this, explored the idea and significance of an ‘identity’. In the process, they also discovered the evident chasm between their identity according to their country (aka the national identification documents) and their identity according to themselves (the objects they consider precious; objects that speak of their personality, such as a beloved heirloom or a cherished artwork).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Over the course of the virtual workshop, with the partition of British India as the backdrop, the participants were encouraged to think over questions of what it means to belong to a nation, how they know (or decide? choose?) who “they” are, and the ways in which physical migration affects that knowledge. The participants also tried to understand and accept the ways in which historical currents have shaped them – and also, through that understanding, they were able to come to terms with their own identity and create newer, freer ways of relating with each other across the boundaries of country and region.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The course also included viewings of related material such as videos about people talking about their perceived identities and its significance to them, as well as poems and stories related to the Partition. The poem <a href="https://scroll.in/article/674238/wh-audens-unsparing-poem-on-the-partition-of-india">‘Partition’ by W. H. Auden</a> and the story <a href="https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article/toba-tek-singh">‘Toba Tek Singh’ by Saadat Hasan Manto</a> were 2 pieces of literature that were discussed extensively during the course.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        In addition to the discussions on ‘identity’, the workshop also touched upon the topic of ‘climate change’ and how the long-held grudge between India and Pakistan, and for that matter, other nations in similar positions, should be set aside in the light of global concerns.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        This workshop was conducted by Sonali Sathaye, an anthropologist with a deep interest in education, social justice, and preserving the natural world, and Akanksha Maglani, a designer and educator whose research and practice lie at the intersection of the evolution and experience of the museum as an institution, and its purpose in a cross-cultural frame.

<p>
                                        AnantU student Suchit Thakkar  published a paper on ‘Automatic Temperature Detection using Touchless Door Bell’ in International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology. Assisted by faculty members, Parth Shah and Milind Chitale and co-authored by Nikita Shah, Assistant Professor, Sal College of Engineering, the paper highlighted how people can enter commercial spaces using contactless doorbell systems.

</p>    
<p>
                                        The automated temperature and buzzing system contain sensors which will measure the person’s temperature at the entry point and allow admission if it is below the permissible level. The device, which operates by hand movements, will generate a green light upon detection of temperature and the doorbell will buzz automatically, allowing the person to enter without touching any surface, common walls or doors. If the  temperature is high and the gate is not opening at that  moment the guard or the house member will get to know that the person standing outside has a high temperature  and has a fever or some problem within the body. 

</p>                                        
<p>
                                        This system can be used at every possible entry point to  check the body parameters.  It can majorly be used in offices  and crowded places where a maximum number of people  are visiting in a single day.

                                        The ANUBOT follows an open-source design published as a DIY project under the name of ‘Otto’. The latest innovation ANUBOT, a cute dancing robot, an initiative of the Makerspace team, aimed at making people familiar with several aspects of design technology and the process.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The team considered various permutations and combinations of processes and techniques while creating this project. Such techniques involved 3D printing all of the required parts, assembling the robot, using an Arduino to drive it and programming the Arduino to make the robot. The parts themselves were printed from PLA and ABS filaments and the files from the otto project were tweaked to be compatible with these materials. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                        ANUBOT, following in the footsteps of Otto, can perform a plethora of actions from moonwalking, to detecting and avoiding obstacles when walking. One can even manually control it using a keyboard!

                                        Makerspace, in line with AnantU’s core philosophy rooted in sustainability, has produced yet another project - clay pot air cooler - which derives its energy from renewable sources such as the sunlight and uses sustainable materials like clay pots.

</p>    
<p>
                                        The project ‘Green Solution’- A solar-powered air: A tabletop clay pot air cooler, welded materials such as clay pot, solar panel, tiny fan (cooling fan for pc) and simple wiring with the intention to demonstrate to the students, the effect of evaporative cooling while using a natural resource such as sunlight to drive something as simple as a fan.  The project was completed in a few hours using only natural resources in terms of both material and energy. Moreover, the ample availability of the clay pots in warm regions like Ahmedabad was an added advantage that deserved to be exhibited.

                                        'Smart bin' is an innovative way to manage garbage systems during COVID-19 pandemic in hospitals, malls, religious and public places and offices. The smart bin opens automatically when the user approaches within its range thus keeping the disposal process contactless and hygienic. Additionally, the bin warns the garbage collectors when it reaches its capacity signalling that it needs to be emptied. This enables the garbage collection systems to function timely and prevent overflowing of garbage. Smart bin serves as a great alternative to the traditional system as it facilitates the cities in keeping areas free of Bio-Waste that could potentially be hazardous and spread infections.

Dr Amareswar Galla, Professor, ICICL, AnantU and International Institute for the Inclusive Museum, Australia, spoke on ‘InDivisible World Views & Indigenous Peoples’ at a Roundtable discussion on Voices of authority: expertise, participation and inclusion in the museum of tomorrow. Organised as part of the LADxNYUAD Symposium, the virtual event comprised roundtable panel discussions, workshops and keynote speeches which aimed at enabling active engagement from a broad range of voices who addressed the challenges and responsibilities facing the museums today. 
</p>
<p>
The discussion explored how museums can examine structures, reassess expertise and create an inclusive space promoting gender, equality, racial justice amidst the context where museum staff and visitors call for transparency in its leadership and governance.
</p>
<p>
Dr Amareswar Galla, Professor, ICICL, AnantU and International Institute for the Inclusive Museum, Australia, also spoke at the roundtable on ‘Creativity, design, art and cultural heritage as decarbonisation pathways for cities and buildings’ as part of the November Dialogues, held in the recent past. Themed on ‘A Culture of Resilience: Mobilising Arts, Culture and Heritage to Win the Race to Zero in the Asia-Pacific Region, the event was hosted by Climate Heritage Network (CHN) and conducted in three parts across different time zones. 
</p>
<p>
Planned by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) High-Level Climate Champions for Climate Action – Nigel Topping and Gonzalo Muñoz, the dialogues highlighted the concrete culture-based strategies that are being implemented through new partnerships between cultural actors and stakeholders across sectors. 
</p>
<p>
The dialogue explored the role that arts, culture and heritage can play in achieving a climate-resilient world, highlighted strategies for rooting resilience measures in the values, traditions, and wisdom of communities to help assure more durable outcomes and explored ways to overcome the barriers for a better future.

                                        The incessant expansion of cities has created a huge impact on the built environment, such as unruly urban planning, resource depletion, pollution and many more. Lack of knowledge and evaluation of the state employing multiple perspectives has increased the chances of haphazard planning thereby,affecting the built environment. To this end, Anant Fellowship, AnantU’s flagship programme, initiated the Anant Fellowship Online webinar series, a platform that brings young solutionaries and stalwarts in the domain of built environment on a single podium to learn, work, strategies and find solutions to the looming challenges in the built environment. Students, academicians, industry experts and practitioners from various contexts, bound by their worries about the built environment, come together to devise sustainable ways to better our surroundings. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        In the past couple of months, Anant Fellowship conducted various webinars which introduced the young solutionaries to experts comprising Ms Aruna Roy   (Co-founder of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan); Dr Anunaya Chaubey (Provost, AnantU); Ramon Magsaysay awardee Dr Rajendra Singh (Water Conservationist and Environmentalist); Vivek Gilani (Managing Director of CBALANCE and Co-founder of India’s first Carbon-Footprint-Calculation and Reduction movement); and Mr Kartik Shastri (Founder of Remedy Health and FillMyFork). The webinar series allowed Fellows to understand theories and practices at ground level and offered them an opportunity to learn, discuss their concerns and find solutions to the challenges of the built environment.

                                        Ms Aruna Roy, who spoke on the ‘Survival of the Welfare State’, introduced the Fellows to the philosophy of Fabian Socialism. She remarks how the idea of the welfare state is ingrained in the constitution of India-both in letter and spirit, delved into the history of the welfare state, its conception and its importance in the current scenario. In addition, she added that one must look beyond the theories to unravel the nuances of the welfare state, for it is the practice that will help one understand the idea of the welfare state and make one.

                                        Mr Karthik Shastri, known for his unique approach to applying ancient wisdom in the modern context, illuminated the importance of daily reflective practices that would take us from who we are to who we desire to be. He highlighted how emotions help one evolve and solve the discomfort and credits many teachers (spiritual and otherwise) through whom he has inculcated his wisdom and experience. The session focused on self-growth, an important component of the Anant Fellowship programme, and how one can make an impactful contribution to the built environment by adopting an empathetic approach.

    Launched on World Heritage Day, the ‘Heritage Matters’ webinar series brings forth various aspects of heritage and suggests ways to preserve this legacy. Recently the International Center for Inclusive Cultural Leadership (ICICL) concluded its first season of live and interactive webinars, which comprised twelve sessions on various issues concerning heritage, museums and architectural legacy. These webinars, which saw whopping participation of 5,300 attendees and 45 panellists from 129 countries for the first ten webinars, aimed at initiating conversations to identify root problems, ideate solutions and spread awareness about the issues that affect the masses together, especially amidst the pandemic and offer a view into the future post-pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
    In continuation of the series, ICICL organised its eleventh webinar on ‘Writing Architecture’ with panellists Dr Wiendu Nuryanti (Professor, Architecture and Planning, Gadjah Mada University and former Vice Minister of Education and Culture, Indonesia); Nandini Somaya Sampat (Architect/ Solicitor and Director, SNK Somaya & Kalappa Consultants); and Neha Nair (Architect and AnantU faculty). Hosted by Dr Amareswar Galla, Professor, ICICL, AnantU and International Institute for the Inclusive Museum, Australia, the webinar interrogated the accessibility, relevance and contextuality of writing architecture.  It explored the interdisciplinary nature and accessibility across specialisms and the potentials and possibilities of writing architecture. It will also discuss the capabilities needed to embed architecture writing in professional and educational agencies and its practice in local languages in a postcolonial context. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Dr Nuryanti marked that writing architecture should be inspired by the design process and expanded on the creative writing process, the Indonesian Experience where oral traditions are dominant, and what lessons one can learn about writing architecture. Architect Neha Nair stressed the importance of writing in vernacular language to engage more people with architecture. She also added that architectural writings should include local arts and crafts as it’s a testimonial of our culture, civilization, humility, teamwork, inclusivity and sustainability. She marked that there are diverse voices who need to be heard and embraced with India’s history.
    </p>
    <p>
    ICICL concluded its first season with the twelfth webinar on ‘Heritage and Values’ with panellists Dr Ana Pereira Roders (UNESCO Chair in Heritage and Values, TUDelft); Professor Rabindra Vasavada (Architect FRAS, Former Head, Centre for Conservation Studies, CRDU CEPT University); and Ritika Khanna (Heritage Consultant and Researcher, MA in World Heritage). Hosted by Dr Amareswar Galla, Professor, ICICL, AnantU and International Institute for the Inclusive Museum, Australia, the webinar examined the opened up opportunities during the pandemic that allowed to address inequities in the system; transform education and workplaces; rethink leadership and; scope new approaches to the climate crisis. The panellists discussed the values of the built environment and urban conservation to make cities more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, and address the inDivisibility of heritage and values for future possibilities and normalities.

Comedy Cartel, a platform for budding comedians, a thoughtful new addition by our foundation year students to our applaudable bunch of exciting clubs, hosted their first ever standup comedy online event, ‘Diwahahali’ on the 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2020. 10 performers were chosen from sample videos sent by those who wished to humour us around the theme of Diwali. In addition to an amazing group of AnantU performers, Jeeya Sethi, a renowned standup comedian graced the evening by being the host, hence by encouraging the performers to be their raw authentic self. More than 100+ viewers thronged the event to enjoy this laugh riot.  The momentum was maintained with a second event on the 19<sup>th</sup> of December of the same nature where Raunaq Rajani, an eminent standup comedian dignified the event with his 25-minute bit amongst four new performers. The event saw the same intensity of triumph which had opened doors for more such events.

                                    <li>The left hemisphere of the brain is (generally) said to control writing, speaking, mathematical calculation, reading, and is the primary area for language, while the right hemisphere is (generally) said to possess capabilities for problem-solving, recognizing faces, symbolic reasoning, art, and spatial relationships. 
                                    </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                    Due to their separate yet essential functions, communication between them is essential for the proper functioning of the brain. Thus, the corpus callosum, a thick nerve tract that connects and hence enables the communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, is very important.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    In addition, the right eye and hand are connected to the left hemisphere and vice versa.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, one of the treatments for patients with severe epilepsy is the severing of the corpus callosum, called corpus callosotomy, and it is an effective last-resort cure for the same (though now having been edged out by far less radical solutions). Those who have undergone this procedure are referred to as ‘split-brain’ patients because their brain has been split into two.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    As can be expected from the nature of this procedure, split-brain patients have been known to suffer a variety of rather interesting side-effects. More serious side effects manifest in such a way that it gives the impression of there being 2 brains in one body, such as in the case of a man who had a strange experience while getting dressed - one hand-pulled his pants up (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and the other hand pulled it down (the other side did not). This, however, is quite rare, and more minor side-effects are usually observed more often.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Minor side effects, however, are certainly quite curious and demonstrate the separate specializations of each hemisphere very clearly indeed. For example, split-brain patients were presented with a picture of an object to only their right hemisphere (left eye), and they were unable to name it or describe it. There were no verbal responses to the picture at all. This is because since only the right hemisphere perceives the image, it cannot articulate it as the language center is present in the left hemisphere, which is unable to see the image at all (right eye).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, if the patient was able to reach under the screen with their left hand to touch various objects, they were able to pick the one that had been shown in the picture. This is because the right hemisphere can comprehend tactile sensations and since the left hand (hence, the right hemisphere) can perceive the object, it could process the information through pure touch, even though verbalization was impossible since the left hemisphere that controls it could not see it at all.

                                    <p>
                                        As the pandemic progressed, the dogs became territorial because of their shrinking food spots. They saw the beagle as an outsider who was encroaching on the area that they believed was theirs. A group of dogs leaped forward and started running towards the beagle. The beagle started running, choosing its instinct of flight rather than fight when he saw the apparent danger in front of his eyes.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        He managed to escape. However, he still had no place to eat.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Then one day, he smelt something. A strong smell of food overpowered his nose. He leaped forward and ran towards the source.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        As he reached the source, he could see a person handing out food to the street dogs. He was one of the good Samaritans who used to feed stray animals.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        There was a crowd of dogs and he tried to get in. The crowd was dense to breakthrough. After a while, the crowd thinned and he reached the front. For the first time since the pandemic, he got something good to eat. So, every day, he would arrive at that spot waiting for the person. His arrival was a highly anticipated event. With time, their bark became a sign of arrival for the one who fed them.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Things gradually became normal. The government announced the Unlock phases and people come back to the streets. With the arrival of people, however, the nameless beagle became anxious. His surroundings were changing once again.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        In his frenzy state of mind, he started walking. Nervously, aimlessly, and with a hollowness that he felt in his heart. Without seeing the cars, he tried to cross the street. Cars came to a halt as they honked their horn for the nameless beagle to move away. As he walks on the footpath, he sees two security guards at the gates of an apartment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The apartment hoarding read ‘Prime Orchid’. For the nameless beagle, it was just some random assortment of shapes and colors. He knew it held some meaning to humans. The watchmen were eating something. He went near them and did the only thing he felt like doing: Wag his tail.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “He seems hungry,” said the tall watchman.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “I guess he can have some of the biscuits,” said the short watchman and threw a biscuit towards him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The nameless beagle ate the biscuit and ate some more as the watchmen kept on giving him some.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        With time, he was adopted by society. Every day, someone used to come and treat him to some food and play with him. The people in society liked him a lot.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “Shouldn’t we give him a name?” said someone.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “What should it be?” asked another.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “How about Brownie?” a child shouted.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        The nameless beagle gave out a short bark of delight.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “I think he likes it”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        “So, from now on, his name is Brownie”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        This was the story of how the nameless beagle was nameless no more.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Well at some point in life, each one of us, (I am pretty sure about) has wondered, if we can go back in time and can change what just happened to us, or we would like to redo all the things so, we could be on a different position, where we are now, but we cannot transcend the dimensions of Time and Space to get there, so we say “umm let’s see Doraemon.” But then a question arises in our subconscious mind at 3 am-midnight, will we ever be able to travel through time? There, it all begins... 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Ever looked up at the night sky, at all those stars, what are you seeing? Do you think that collage of stars exists? Most of them do not. When you look at the sky at night you are seeing the past because it takes an obscene amount of time for the light from those stars to reach earth, and in that time those stars may have disappeared, who knows.  
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Newton says “Time is like an arrow once left cannot come back”, which means it is absolute, but another Legend from our history says “Time is like a river, it slows down when it gets hit at the edge of a stone”, so by saying this Einstein means it is relative, whom to trust, let's find out! 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        If Time is absolute, it simply means time would be the same for the ones who are residing on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn as compared to Earth, but we cannot deny the fact that time is different for inhabitants of the International Space Station, it runs slow for them, that simply means its runs different for all of us, sorry to say that but the point goes to Einstein, time is relative it's like a river which gets affected by large masses like sun, our Earth, can’t forget those black holes, where time nearly stops for the observer. So, the conclusion is Time is relative, you can twist it, turn it, but is it possible to travel through it? 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        So, there are things that can transcend the dimensions of Time and Space, it is  Gravity and also Love according to Interstellar, so where there is more Gravitational Force, time slows down, for instance near a black hole, the best way to understand it, is to send your best-friend near black and have a video call with him, if he says “hello”, you would probably hear it as, “haaaallllloooooooooo”, and that “hello” can be a yearlong, weird, but that’s the reality, fingers crossed, but when he returns, he would be the oldest man alive, but according to him, yesterday he celebrated his 20th birthday.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        So that’s the way we can travel through the future, as your best-friend traveled 200 years in the future in just two years, no worries the credit goes to the dead you. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        But what about traveling to the past and killing him before he leaves, so he won’t take your credits, is there a way of doing it? 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Ever heard about the Grandfather paradox, where his grandchild goes back in the past and tries to kill him, just because he hasn’t sold his kidney to buy him a new iPhone...but unfortunately, he didn’t succeed in doing so, why? just because he became greedy and planned to get both of his kidneys so he can buy a mac too and God punished him, well the reason is different. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        He didn’t succeed because of the reality that he is born, from his father, similarly his father from his grandfather, so he can’t kill him because he exists in the present, if his grandfather would be killed in the past he would never be born, similarly, it goes with you, you simply cannot kill your best friend because he has arrived alive in the future, so you cannot change what has happened, but if somehow you are successful in doing so, you have killed a genetically similar copy of your best-friend that too in a parallel multiverse, which is not him, well you have killed an innocent then. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        There is also a theory of Quantum Superpositioning, where your best friend can be simultaneously 50% dead and alive, and that’s the reason for the weirdness of the double-slit experiment, well not get into this, the conclusion is they can do  Quantum superpositioning and we can’t at least in the present time. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        It was just a glimpse of how weird and unusually time traveling is, there are tons of theories that are competing against each other in the race of traveling through time, but only Time will say who wins, but still, the same question troubles every night at 3 am “can we ever travel through time?”, but this Time one more question gets added, “When and How?”
                                        </p>

                                    <p>Advaita is an incredibly curious person, with a talent for getting lost on the internet (and lost
                                        in thought). She has vast interests ranging from melodies and mysteries to paradoxes and
                                        pictographs and anime…the list goes on and on. The one true love of her life is food, and
                                        she's never hesitant to try out something new, be it a food, an experience or an adventure!
                                        Learning new things is her one goal in life and- Did I mention she absolutely adores cats?</p>

    On two roads diverged by woods, he always takes the one less travelled by.
